\title{Center and Scale Response Variable}
\usage{
response_variable(Y, c)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric vector representing the response variable.}

\item{c}{A numeric value that controls the scaling factor applied to the first and last elements of the response vector.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with the same length as \code{Y}, where the response variable has been centered and scaled.
}
\description{
This function centers and scales the response variable by subtracting its mean and applying a scaling factor to the first and last elements.

# Example: Center and scale a response variable
Y <- rnorm(10)
c <- 0.05
Y_centered <- response_variable(Y, c)
