\item{c}{A numeric value that controls the scaling factor applied to the first and last rows of the matrix.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with the same dimensions as \code{X}, where the rows have been centered and scaled.
}
\description{
This function centers and scales the input design matrix, adjusting the first and last rows by a scaling factor.
